Vanuatu is a Pacific island adventure far beyond any notions of cruise-ship ports and flashy resorts. 
Deserted beaches, ancient culture, remote and rugged islands and world-class diving are just a small part of the magnetism of this scattered 80-plus island archipelago.
This trip is a must for biking fanatics.
