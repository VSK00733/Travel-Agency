With its 468 sq km of tumbling valleys, Romanesque churches and sky-reaching peaks wedged between France and Spain, Andorra offers by far the best ski slopes and resort facilities in the entire Pyrenees. Once the snow melts, there's outstanding walking, ranging from easy strolls to demanding day hikes in the Principality's higher, more remote reaches, where you can wander for hours, almost alone.
