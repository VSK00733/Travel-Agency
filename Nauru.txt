Nauru is a small island in the South Pacific Ocean south of the Marshall Islands and is the world's third-smallest country; only Monaco and the Vatican City are smaller. It is one of the least travelled to countries in the world, but has much to feast your eyes upon. It will be a great tour for history buffs as it is famous for its WWII relics. Also being somewhat scenic, it offerrs a good distraction from the mundane routine.
