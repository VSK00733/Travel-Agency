Ivory Coast is a country of extremes; a land of pulsating metropolises and pristine rainforests, vast churches and verdant hills, fancy restaurants and sprawling street stalls. Ivory Coast's true beauty really shines through when you get out of the cities. There are no fewer than 8 national parks in the country. Expect to see anything from lions and leopards to aardvarks and Africal elephants. Its beautiful beaches are enough to entice anybody.
